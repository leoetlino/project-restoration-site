      <h2 class="text-left">1.5.9</h2>
      <h3 class="mb-4"><time datetime="2022-01-02">January 2, 2022</time></h3>

      <p>I am happy to announce the release of Project Restoration 1.5.9, the first set of bug fixes and improvements since 2020!</p>
      <p>To install or update Project Restoration, <a target="_blank" href="https://restoration.zora.re/#setup">follow the instructions here</a>. For those of you who aren't familiar with this project, <a target="_blank" href="https://restoration.zora.re">check out our home page</a>!</p>

      <h3 class="my-4">Changes since 1.5.8</h3>
      <ul class="long-list">
        <li>Several tweaks to the Elegy of Emptiness and Stone Tower were made to improve the user experience.<ul>
            <li>The statue is now spawned faster and it is now impossible to accidentally step off floor switches before the statue has materialised. This helps avoid unncessary floor switch cutscenes.</li>
            <li>Stone Tower blocks now move at a less dizzying speed.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>ISG (Infinite Sword Glitch) was reimplemented.</li>
        <li>The console sound setting is now honoured; the game no longer forces surround mode. This can improve sound quality in some setups.</li>
        <li>Fixed a softlock that could occur if an owl statue is hit immediately after playing the ocarina.</li>
        <li>Fixed Link being able to transform into Goron Link while carrying Mystery or Moldy Milk.</li>
        <li>Fixed a rare, random crash that could occur if ZR was held during transitions.</li>
        <li>Fixed quick arrow swapping quirks when L targeting.</li>
        <li>Further improvements to overall system stability and other minor adjustments have been made to enhance the user experience.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="my-4">HD HUD update</h3>
      <p>Users of the <a href="https://restoration.zora.re/hd-hud">HD HUD mod</a> should set up the patch <em>and</em> custom textures again: some HD textures weren&#39;t usable because of a packaging mistake and A and B button text could show up blurry.</p>

      <p>The latest version of the mod also fixes an invalid memory read that could occur whenever Tatl wants to give a hint to Link. The bug actually doesn't crash the game on Citra, but better fix it anyway!</p>

      <h3 class="my-4">Elegy of Emptiness comparison</h3>
      <p>This video is slightly old and several tweaks have been made since it was recorded (notably, the darkness effect was removed), but here is a comparison between the original game and Project Restoration:</p>
