          <ul>
            <li>The <i>moving</i> platforms in Deku Palace and Woodfall Temple now actually always <i>move</i>.</li>
            <li>Captain Keeta now walks as fast as in the original game, which restores the challenge of the chasing
              mini-game.</li>

              hints.</li>

          <p class="lead">For the classic experience</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Owl statues can be activated by striking them with a sword.</li>
            <li>It is possible to control Goron Link rolling just like in the Nintendo 64 version: hold A and move to
              roll, release A to stop. The classic control scheme co-exists with the new one.</li>

          <p class="lead">Bug fixes</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fixes a game bug that caused the "heart container get" sound not to play after getting four heart pieces.
            </li>
            <li>Fixes a game bug that prevented the player from leaving free camera mode by targeting when Zora swimming
              or Goron rolling.</li>
            <li>Fixes a possible softlock during the Twinmold boss intro.</li>
            <li>Fixes a possible softlock when fighting Gyorg during phase 1.</li>

      <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

      <h3>My 3DS crashes</h3>
      <p>Delete any file you copied while following this guide and follow the instructions carefully again.</p>
      <p>In particular, make sure that you have renamed <code>exheader_legacy.bin</code> to <code>exheader.bin</code>.</p>
      <p>If you are absolutely sure you have followed the instructions correctly, try all three patch variants (v100/v101/v110) until one of them works.</p>

      <h3>Citra crashes</h3>
      <p>Delete any file you copied while following this guide and follow the instructions carefully again.</p>
      <p>If you are absolutely sure you have followed the instructions correctly, try all three patch variants (v100/v101/v110) until one of them works.</p>
      <p>You may also need to set the console region in Citra's settings manually.</p>

      <h3>The patch isn't applied</h3>
      <p>Make sure that you put the patch files (<code>code.bps</code> and <code>exheader.bin</code>) into the right folder. Ensure that you are using the correct title ID for your game.</p>
      <p>If you are playing on a 3DS console, check whether game patching is enabled.</p>

      <h3>[Citra] After I press ZR, the button stays pressed permanently</h3>
      <p>That is caused by an incorrect controller mapping in Citra. It is not a Project Restoration issue. When mapping the controller, hold the trigger on your controller before attempting to map the button in Citra.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>Is such a patch available for Ocarina of Time 3D?</h3>
      <p>As of March 2020, <b>no</b>. While I am interested in making a QoL patch for OoT3D, unfortunately I have no time to work on such a project at the moment. But unlike its sequel, OoT3D does not urgently need a Project Restoration-style mod anyway :)</p>

      <h3>Hero mode?</h3>
      <p>Currently, I have no time to work on hero mode either. And hero mode is somewhat out of the scope of this project anyway.</p>

      <h3>Restored lighting? The bright colours ruin the atmosphere!</h3>
      <p><i>Project Restoration</i> attempts to fix what regressed in MM3D by restoring original mechanics and adding QoL improvements. I do not consider the graphical changes a regression. Even colourful games can be dark, and I'd argue that in <i>Majora's Mask</i> the unique atmosphere mostly comes from the stunning storytelling and narrative.</p>

      <h3>How do I update Project Restoration?</h3>
      <p>Simply follow the <a href="#setup">setup instructions</a> again.</p>
      <p>For 3DS console users, you do not need to set up Luma3DS from scratch again.</p>

      <h3>How was this made?</h3>
      <p>By reverse engineering the game to understand how it works (at least partially). No, I don't work at Grezzo! For more details, you're encouraged to look at the source code.</p>
