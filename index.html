        <h3>...and plenty of other improvements</h3>
        <p class="lead">Minor adjustments to enhance the player's experience</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Link no longer plays the Elegy of Emptiness a second time after it's been played once. Considering it
            needs to be played 10+ times to beat Stone Tower Temple normally, this makes the dungeon a lot less tedious.
          </li>
          <li>For similar reasons, the Song of Soaring is only repeated once during a play session.</li>
          <li>The speed of Stone Tower blocks is adjusted for a more pleasant climbing experience.</li>
          <li>Free camera mode can be used more often, notably when targeting, talking or playing the ocarina.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="lead">Less handholding</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <i>moving</i> platforms in Deku Palace and Woodfall Temple now actually always <i>move</i>.</li>
          <li>Captain Keeta now walks as fast as in the original game, which restores the challenge of the chasing
            mini-game.</li>
          <li>Link can now leave the Swordman's School during training if necessary to avoid wasting time.</li>
          <li>The Bombers will no longer distract the player from a particular cutscene just to ensure you get their
            hints.</li>
          <li>The new Sheikah hint stone will also no longer distract the player during an important cutscene in the
            Clock Tower.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="lead">For the classic experience</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Owl statues can be activated by striking them with a sword.</li>
          <li>It is possible to control Goron Link rolling just like in the Nintendo 64 version: hold A and move to
            roll, release A to stop. The classic control scheme co-exists with the new one.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="lead">Bug fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixes a game bug that caused the "heart container get" sound not to play after getting four heart pieces.
          </li>
          <li>Fixes a game bug that prevented the player from leaving free camera mode by targeting when Zora swimming
            or Goron rolling.</li>
          <li>Fixes a possible softlock during the Twinmold boss intro.</li>

      <h2>Compatibility</h2>
      <p><em>Project Restoration</em> works on both real 3DS consoles (with the eShop and gamecard versions) and on the Citra emulator. While some features make use of the new ZL/ZR buttons, playing on an old 3DS is still possible.</p>
      <p>Existing save files can be used without any issue.</p>
      <p>Patches are provided for all versions of <em>Majora's Mask 3D</em>. However, all versions other than v1.0 (v100) will be temporarily and automatically downgraded to ensure the code patches work.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="setup" class="container">
      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <ol start="0">
        <li>Download <a href="https://github.com/leoetlino/project-restoration/releases">the latest release of <em>Project Restoration</em></a> (mm3d_project_restoration_vx.x.x-xxxxxxxx.7z). Open the archive with a tool like 7-Zip.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>1. Determine the game version</h3>
      <p>The archive contains three folders: v100, v101 and v110. Each of them corresponds to a MM3D game version.</p>
      <p>Because <em>Project Restoration</em> works by patching game code and injecting new code, it is essential that you figure out which MM3D version you have in order to use the appropriate patch for your situation.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you have <b>MM3D 1.1 (game card with 1.1 preinstalled)</b>, use v110.</li>
        <li>If you have <b>MM3D 1.0 (<i>non-updated</i> eShop or <i>non-updated</i> 1.0 gamecard)</b>, use v100.</li>
        <li>If you have <b>MM3D 1.1 (<i>updated</i> eShop or <i>updated</i> 1.0 gamecard)</b>, use v100, and <b>only</b> if it doesn't work, try v101.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Determine the game title ID</h3>
      <p>Because the 3DS is a region-locked console, each region has its own version of <i>Majora's Mask 3D</i>, each with its own title ID.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For the European release: 0004000000125600</li>
        <li>For the American release: 0004000000125500</li>
        <li>For the Japanese release: 00040000000D6E00</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the following instructions, replace any mention of <code>TITLE_ID</code> with your game's title ID.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>3. For Citra users</h3>
        <p>This guide assumes that you know how to use Citra. If this is not the case, refer to the <a href="https://citra-emu.org/">official website</a> for help.</p>
        <ol start="3">
          <li>Right click on the game in the game list and <b>select <em>Open Mods Location</em></b>.</li>
          <li><b>Copy</b> <code>code.bps</code> to that directory.</li>
          <li><b>Copy</b> <code>exheader.bin</code> to that directory.</li>
        </ol>

      <section>
        <h3>3. For console users</h3>
        <p>This guide assumes that you have a homebrewed 3DS with Luma3DS. If this is not the case, follow <a href="https://3ds.hacks.guide/">this guide</a> for help.</p>
        <ol start="3">
          <li>As of March 2020, upstream Luma3DS has a <a href="https://github.com/AuroraWright/Luma3DS/pull/1287">critical bug in the loader</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AuroraWright/Luma3DS/pull/1349">missing support for BPS patching</a>. Therefore, <b>download</b> <a href="https://github.com/leoetlino/Luma3DS/releases">this version of Luma3DS</a> and put the <code>boot.firm</code> file at the root of your SD card.</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/AuroraWright/Luma3DS/wiki/Optional-features">Enable game patching in Luma's menu</a>.</li>
          <li><b>Create</b> the /luma/titles/<code>TITLE_ID</code>/ directory on your SD card (if it doesn't already exist).</li>
          <li><b>Copy</b> <code>code.bps</code> to that directory.</li>
          <li><b>Copy</b> <code>exheader_legacy.bin</code> to that directory and <b>rename</b> the file to <code>exheader.bin</code>.</li>

      <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

      <h3>My 3DS or Citra crashes</h3>
      <p>Delete any file you copied while following this guide and follow the instructions carefully again.</p>
      <p>In particular, if you are playing on a 3DS, make sure that you have renamed <code>exheader_legacy.bin</code> to <code>exheader.bin</code>.</p>
      <p>If you are absolutely sure you have followed the instructions correctly, try all three patch variants (v100/v101/v110) until one of them works.</p>

      <h3>The patch isn't applied</h3>
      <p>Make sure that you put the patch files (<code>code.bps</code> and <code>exheader.bin</code>) into the right folder. Ensure that you are the correct title ID for your game.</p>
      <p>If you are playing on a 3DS console, check whether game patching is enabled.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>Is such a patch available for Ocarina of Time 3D?</h3>
      <p>As of March 2020, <b>no</b>. While I am interested in making a QoL patch for OoT3D, unfortunately I have no time to work on such a project at the moment. But unlike its sequel, OoT3D does not urgently need a Project Restoration-style mod anyway :)</p>

      <h3>Hero mode?</h3>
      <p>Currently, I have no time to work on hero mode either. And hero mode is somewhat out of the scope of this project anyway.</p>

      <h3>Restored lighting? The bright colours ruin the atmosphere!</h3>
      <p><i>Project Restoration</i> attempts to fix what regressed in MM3D by restoring original mechanics and adding QoL improvements. I do not consider the graphical changes a regression. Even colourful games can be dark, and I'd argue that in <i>Majora's Mask</i> the unique atmosphere mostly comes from the stunning storytelling and narrative.</p>

      <h3>How was this made?</h3>
